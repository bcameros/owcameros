        <div class="hero-about">
          <p>
            I'm a sports broadcaster who focuses on clear, descriptive storytelling &mdash;
            helping viewers understand not just what happened, but why it matters.
            My goal is always to bring energy, context, and narrative to the games I cover,
            whether I'm anchoring in studio, reporting live, or breaking down plays as an analyst.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside my on-air work, I've developed strong producing experience as Executive Producer
            of <em>After The Whistle</em>, a weekly live sports show created from scratch in a single night.
            Producing has strengthened my editorial judgment and given me a deeper understanding of what talent
            needs to succeed on camera.
          </p>
          <p>
            That combination of broadcasting and producing experience gives me a unique perspective in sports media:
            the on-air presence of a broadcaster, and the behind-the-scenes awareness of a producer.
